# PSOCL

An OpenCL implementation of particle swarm optimizaion.

Compiled and tested with mingw-w64 v5.0.3 (with mingw32-make) on windows 10.

## Status

At this point, I have the CPU only example working,but its too simple to see if this implementation scales

I have the OpenCL code running, but again, it is with a very simple implementation, not enought to see if it scales well.
