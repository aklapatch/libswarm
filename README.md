# PSOCL

An OpenCL implementation of particle swarm optimizaion.

Compiled and tested with mingw-w64 v5.0.3 (with mingw32-make) on windows 10.

## Status

At this point, I have the CPU only example working,but its too simple to see if this implementation scales

Don't run the OpenCL code, at this point (with a i3-6100U and its inegrated graphics) whenever I run that code, my computer hard locks.
