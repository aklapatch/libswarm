Passing a float * directly to the kernel does not work at all.
I will need to allocate memory on  the GPU to do all calculations

the first couple times I ran the kernel it was very slow, not sure why that is.
probably caching some data.

also note opencl is very sensitive and hard to deal with. Things such as int cannot be substituted for size_t
